 *You can have postgres either installed in your system or running in docker
 
 ## Setup
 
### Frontend

Install dependencies:

Clone this github repository: https://github.com/sandhyasrini/Intervention-Randomizer-UI
```
cd Intervention-Randomizer-UI
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
Run the frontend:
```
npm run start
```
or
```
yarn start
```
### Backend

Install dependencies:

Clone the git repository:
https://github.com/sandhyasrini/Beyondplay-intervention-randomizer-api
```
cd Beyondplay-intervention-randomizer-api
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
Run the backend
```
npm run serve
 ```
 or
```
yarn serve
```

### Database

* If you have docker setup in your machine, you can follow the below steps to setup DB for the Application

Go to the API Project folder cloned in your local system

Build docker Image for Postgres:

```
docker build -t my-postgres-db ./ --no-cache
```

Check if image built:

```
docker images
```

eg:
```
$ docker images -a
REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
my-postgres-db   latest    38036a25ec7b   13 hours ago   379MB

```

Run the image as a container:

```
docker run -d --name my-postgresdb-container -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD={password} my-postgres-db
```
Make sure the beyond_play.sql file is present in the folder before running the container. This file creates the DB required for the application.

* If you have Postgres installed in your local system, create a Database called 
beyond_play and run the beyond_play.sql in postgres to create the DB and inject data.

In the .env file, add your Database URL:

```
DATABASE_URL="postgres://{username}:{password}@localhost:5432/beyond_play"
```
If you're running in docker, the default username would be postgres unless specified otherwise

## Accessing UI

The UI can be accessed in http://localhost:3000

## Test cases

To run the test cases locally,

```
npm run test
```

And for the code coverage

```
npm run coverage
```


## Todos / WIP:

These are some functionalities, updates that are being implemented.

* E2E testing using Cypress
* Authentication/Authorisation
* Ability to search and find individual user
